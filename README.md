# Ex.No.10
Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## Reg. No. 212223060086

## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Procedure
#### 1. Understanding Prompt Patterns

1. Query Decomposition: Breaks complex tasks into smaller tasks.

2. Decision-Making Prompts: Helps the model choose one direction from many.

3. Answer Engineering: Controls structure, tone, format, and depth.

4. Fact-Check Prompts: Adds accuracy checks for data-based content.

5. Tail Generation: Extends sections with deeper analysis.

6. Menu Actions: Gives the AI a list of actions to choose from.

7. Semantic Filtering: Sets tone (formal, educational, creative, etc.).

#### 2. Selected Test Case Scenarios

From the given list, the following two are selected:
